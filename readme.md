# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

Welcome. This is your assignment repository.

In this file, we will expect a brief description of your project in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format.
Try to keep it to a maximum of about 300 words.
Though shorter is no problem.


TThe description should include a summary of your site content and the primary audience you are targeting.
Also include a brief description of how you have organised the content (a few sentences is fine) for the audience.
Make some specific reference to how you have adapted your site for different screen sizes.

If there are any parts of your code or user interface that need further explanation, you can include that here.
If anything is broken or doesn't quite work properly, you may explain what it SHOULD do.

You **must** include references (including links) to any external resources/videos/code examples that you have used here.

## Things to do

- Replace the content inside [index.html](index.html) with your own structured HTML.
- Replace the [replaceme.css](replaceme.css) and [replaceme.js](js/replaceme.js) files with your own files.
- Update the `<link>` and `<script>` elements to point to your new files.
- Replace the contents of this file (readme.md) with your own short project description as detailed above.

>We don't expect there to be much left of the original content in these files once you are done.
It should be all your own code.

This website is made to highlight my work and to introduce myself to potential employers. This website aims to express my personality, education, experience and capability. I can demonstrate to potential employers my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with this website. Navy blue, gold, and white make up the three color scheme I've chosen to build this website. Users will find it very simple to navigate through my website because I used @mediaqueries to make it responsive. In addition to this, the website contains 4 pages, which include Home Page, Profile Page, Experience Page and Contact Page. To help the users recognise me visually, I have a photograph on my website, along with a brief description that gives them an overview of who I am. On the other hand, my profile page was made so that I could show my CV to potential employers and provide them a summary of my experience. In a gallery format, the experience page will also go into great depth on the schooling and employment I've had throughout the course of my life. Finally, if the employers are satisfied with my portfolio or CV, they may contact me through the contact page. The user will have two alternatives when they visit the contact page: they may either fill out the contact form and contact me, or they can contact me by phone, email, or social media. Last but not least, the contact form validation was implemented using JavaScript. This enables users to check that they have entered the proper data before submitting. Using this website will make it simpler for me to convince businesses to hire me.

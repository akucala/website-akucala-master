						<p class="warehousedescription">
							On July 2021, I began working for Amazon as a warehouse worker.
							It was my obligation to arrange the package in the proper area and dispatch it to the
							delivery drivers.
							I gained experience working in a fast-paced environment while working in the warehouse,
							where I had to pick and stage the packages for the drivers to pick up.
							Also, this has increased my confidence in my ability to keep track of time and deliver
							packages on schedule.
							We were given a scanner device to sort the parcels because we were working in a
							fast-paced
							environment, which makes the job simpler because all the information is gathered online
							through that scanner. Addditionally, it was my duty as a worker to ensure health and
							safety
							of the people working around me and I.

						<p class="questdescription">
							On October 2021, I started working for Quest Employment Agency as a Manager.
							It was my responsibility to ensure that I have attended all the emails received by the
							workers and managers
							around the warehouse and reply back to them as soon as possible. Addition it was my duty
							to
							ensure that all
							the shift are scheduled with the correct numbers of associates required by the Managers
							from
							the floor. I used
							to handle three warehouse shifts, and used to tackle any issued raised by the employees
							and
							the managers,
							including changing shifts, updating holiday tracker or delivering induction online on
							Microsoft Teams. As a quest
							employment agency manager, I have worked in many different platforms, such as excel, one
							drive, Microsoft word, in
							order to organise the shift for the employees. This has built my skills such as
							Communication, confidence, team work,
							organising and many more. Indeed, this was one of my favourite experiences. </p>

						<p class="rafdescription">
							I have been part of Royal Air Force – Air Cadets since September 2013, as I had a big
							interest in aviation.
							Throughout my experience in Royal Air Force, I have gained many skills and knowledge,
							such
							as Leadership skills, Communication skills,
							organising skills, Managing skill and many more. It has been a roller-coaster journey
							experience in Royal Air Force, especially when it
							comes to rank promotions. I started with a Cadet rank when I joined and eventually timed
							out
							with a rank of a Flight Sergeant.
							Through this journey, I have completed many qualifications, such as I have achieved part
							task training bronze qualification for flying and gliding,
							master classification, communication, leadership, level 2 CVQO Diploma, and youth first
							aid.
							My interest in Royal Air Force hasn’t changed, as I will
							be joining the squadron as a Staff member and work through the Staff ranks. </p>
